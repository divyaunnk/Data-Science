## Random Forest 

A random forest classifier. Supervised Machine Learning algorithm used for classification problems. It randomly builds decision trees and merges them together to get more accuratre and stable prediction

In this project, random forest classifier has been applied on [homesite quote conversion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion) dataset.

Modeled after [scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).
